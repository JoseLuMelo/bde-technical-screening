## Problem Statement:
2. Cash Minimizer 
Imagine that you are hired by a country’s mint, the entity which prints paper money and 
coins. Your team studies the effectiveness and velocity of money (how quickly it changes 
hands). Your initial task is to write a piece of software which gives a) a set of cash & coin 
denominations, and b) an amount of money to be transferred between two parties, will 
output both the payment & change which minimizes the number of bills & coins which 
need to be exchanged.  For example, let’s take the US common cash denominations (i.e., 
[0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]) and an amount of $19.96.  The payment & 
change which minimizes the number of bills & coins for this exchange is a payment of 20 + 
0.01 and a change of 0.05.
